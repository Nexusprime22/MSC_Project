# MSC Project

This project is made in HTML-CSS-JS. It uses the [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/) and the [Leaflet Routing Machine](https://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/) extension. It is a web-based application that allows to map students’ main points of interest (home, parking, university…), using an Origin-Destination (OD) matrix for these spaces, and facilitating group meetups among them.

You will find all elements of analysis including the complete report in the [analysis](https://github.com/Nexusprime22/MSC_Project/tree/main/analysis) folder.
